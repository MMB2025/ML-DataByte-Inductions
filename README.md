Hello
In the first step, we load the file with its path and store it as a variable. Then, we read the file and load the contents into another variable(taxi_fare_stats).
This has all the data we need. Next we store the feature we need to predict as y(or z) and store the factors associated with it as X(or W) after storing those factors' names as strings in a list.
Then after importing DecisionTreeRegressor from sklearn.tree, we make the model name and fit(train) it with the respective data(X,y or W,z).
Then we use the predict property and predict as required
